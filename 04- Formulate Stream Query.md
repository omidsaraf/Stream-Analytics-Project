For our JSON file that comes as a stream from the Storage Diagnostic Log, we need to create a query as follows:
- Specify the source and destination
- Use Cross Apply and Get Array Element
- Specify the Dataset (reference)
- Analyze the elements we want to fetch
- Specify each element and its belonging layer for writing the SELECT columns
